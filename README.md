### Intro 
For this assignment we were dealing with React to create the bot battler.
Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web
developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through
a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.

### Requirements
* Having a well written README file (like this one)
* Fetch data from local server running JSON DB server

### Installations 
* npm install create-react-app
* npx create-react-app name of the app

### Project Setup
*Create a new project folder.
*Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PUBLIC)
*Add your TM as a contributor to the project.

### Project Guidelines
As a user, I can:

As a user, I should be able to:

* See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotBarracks(BotCollection)`.
* Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotBarracks(BotCollection)`.
* Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
* Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
